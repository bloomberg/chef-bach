# node.run_state[:bcpc_hadoop_disks] is for values we generate at
# runtime, by inspecting the state of the system.  These cannot be

# That run_state is generated in bcpc-hadoop::disks
#
# node[:bcpc][:hadoop][:disks] is for static attributes that we
# know in advance.  These are easily overridden in an environment.
#
# This file contains the static attributes.
