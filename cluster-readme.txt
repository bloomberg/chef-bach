cluster tools

chef-bcpc now includes some sample tools for helping install to real
hardware. 

Cluster definition file : cluster.txt

  Defines your hardware (see the sample file provided for an
  example). You can use vm-to-cluster.sh on the hypervisor to make a
  cluster.txt from your running VMs after booting.

  The expected fields are :

  nodeid hostname mac-address IP-address ILO-IP-Address Cobbler-Profile domain role
  
  numeric nodeid is only required for nodes with BCPC-Hadoop-Head role asigned
  For numeric id range is 1 through 255 
  For BCPC-Hadoop-Worker machines use `-` in the ID field  

  "ILO" stands for Integrated Lights-Out - a management console.
  It's not important for VMs.

Cluster helper scripts

  The following cluster-*.sh scripts use simple wrappers for ssh and
  scp called "nodessh.sh" and "nodescp" which look up the node
  passwords from the knife data bags for your environment. See the
  'ssh, scp wrappers' section at the end of this file for more
  information on this.

cluster-enroll-cobbler.sh

  Using cluster.txt, this tool enrolls or removes nodes from cobbler. 

cluster-assign-roles.sh

  Using cluster.txt, this tool assigns roles to nodes using Chef. This script
  is also the best way to ensure a node is re-Chefed with its correct role as
  certain operations (e.g. 'chef-client -o [...]') will change a nodes role.

cluster-whatsup.sh

  Finds out which nodes are responding on the network. Install fping
  to make this fast.

cluster-vip.sh

  Using your environment file, this tool finds the current VIP
  (virtual IP) on your cluster so you can connect to its services or
  log onto that physical node for maintenance or troubleshooting.

cluster-rechef.sh

  After changing recipes and/or environment files and reloading them
  to the chef server, use this script to instruct all work and head
  nodes to rerun chef-client to pull those updates over to update
  themselves.

ssh, scp wrappers

  The cluster tools rely on the standard tools 'sshpass' and (in many
  cases) 'fping' both of which you should be able to install using
  apt-get. The cluster tools also use nodessh.sh and
  nodescp. nodessh.sh is a simple ssh wrapper that automates looking
  up the encrypted passwords for your environment from the knife data
  bags and then passes it through using sshpass reducing the number of
  times you must supply the sudo passwd. nodescp is a symlink to
  nodessh.sh which is used similarly to scp but leverages the same ssh
  wrapping.
