# Script to assign roles to cluster nodes based on a definition in cluster.txt :
#
# - If no hostname is provided, all nodes will be attempted
#
# - if a nodename is provided, either by hostname or ip address, only
#   that node will be attempted
#
# - if the special nodename "heads" is given, all head nodes will be
#   attempted
#
# - if the special nodename "workers" is given, all work nodes will be
#   attempted
#
# - A node may be excluded by setting its role to something other than
#   "head" or "work" in cluster.txt. For example "done" might be
#   useful for nodes that have been completed
